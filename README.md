# Recommender-System-using-Item-Based-Collaborative-Filtering
The main aim of this project was to implement an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system for a given user using Pearson Correlation and Prediction equations.
The input file ratings-dataset.tsv contains UserId, Mover rating and Movie title. Based on the information of all users, the ratings for movies that a given user has not rated is calculated and based on this information, the movies are recommended that the user would most probably like.
